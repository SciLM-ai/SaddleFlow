"""
Forward-Euler integrator for flow-matching inference.

Given a reactant structure, draws `n_perturbations` independent Gaussian starts
(`x_0 = r_R + ε_rs_pert`), then integrates each trajectory forward under the
velocity field `v_θ(x_t, t)` for `K` uniform Euler steps. Output is a
`(n_perturbations, N, 3)` tensor of candidate saddles. Clustering / Hungarian
matching against reference TSs is done downstream in `utils/eval.py`.

All `n_perturbations` trajectories are batched into a single AtomicData at each
Euler step (one UMA forward per step, not per trajectory). This keeps cost
O(K · one_batched_UMA_forward), independent of how many perturbations you draw.

    """Euler-integrate `n_perturbations` trajectories from x_0 = (R, P) midpoint to t=1.

    Product-conditional flow. Integration starts at the (R, P) midpoint and
    the head receives both (R − x_t) and (P − x_t) per atom (stacked as
    (P*N, 2, 3)) at every flow step. The matching trainer in
    `FlowMatchingLoss.forward` uses the same x_0 = midpoint and the same
    2-endpoint signal, so train/test are aligned. The head must be built
    with `delta_endpoint_channels > 0`. Sampling is deterministic given
    `partner_pos`; the typical inference call passes `sigma_inf=0` and
    `n_perturbations=1` for a single deterministic prediction.

    Args:
        reactant: a sample dict with the same keys used by `FlowMatchingLoss`
            (`start_pos`, `Z`, `cell`, `fixed`, `task_name`, `charge`, `spin`).
            `start_pos` is one endpoint structure (R or P) in Å.
        backbone / global_attn / velocity_head: the UMA backbone and the two
            SaddleFlow modules. The caller is responsible for having set `.eval()`
            on them; this routine does NOT toggle training mode.
        sigma_inf: Gaussian std (Å) for the inference-time perturbation that
            spreads initial positions around the start before Euler integration.
            Decoupled from training; pass 0 for a deterministic prediction.
        n_perturbations: number of independent trajectories. Default 32.
        K: number of Euler steps. Default 50.
        device: override the device (default = `velocity_head`'s device).
        generator: torch.Generator for reproducibility. If provided on CPU while
            the model is on CUDA, perturbations are drawn on CPU and moved —
            identical distribution, just less efficient.
        return_trajectory: if True, also return the full `(K+1, n_perturbations, N, 3)`
            tensor of intermediate positions (including the initial perturbed starts).
        partner_pos: (N, 3) MIC-unwrapped partner positions (R or P). Required;
            same atom ordering as `reactant['start_pos']`.

    Returns:
        `(n_perturbations, N, 3)` candidate saddle positions, wrapped into the unit cell.
        If `return_trajectory` is True, returns a tuple `(final, trajectory)`.
