Flow-matching training loss for SaddleFlow.

Product-conditional straight-line OT: x_0 is taken as the (R, P) midpoint
(`0.5 * (start + partner_un)`), x_1 is the MIC-unwrapped saddle, and the head
receives a per-atom partner-displacement Δ_partner = MIC(partner − x_t) at
every flow step. The R/P doubling in the dataset gives a 50/50 R-side/P-side
split per epoch automatically.

                backbone (no FiLM wrapping, no params trainable). When set,

            eigenmode_head: predicts the saddle's eigenmode from the
                trainable backbone's post-global-attn features (NOT from a
                pre-final velocity-head trunk). Used both for the cos² aux

            eigenmode_loss_weight: scalar multiplier on the eigenmode aux
                loss term. v7-3 default is 0.1.
            use_dimer_residual: v7-4-redesign — when True, the model output
                gets a Dimer-style nudge `v_actual = v_pred + α · F_dimer`

                `frozen_force_backbone` or a working `force_head` so that
                F_dimer can be computed.
            dimer_residual_alpha_init: initial value of α. Default 0.0 — at
                init the nudge contributes nothing and the model is identical
                to v7-3-without-F_dimer-feature; α grows during training as
